# K-Fit - Fitness & Nutrition Website
K-Fit is a responsive and interactive fitness website developed for a university coursework project. It offers users a comprehensive wellness experience, featuring personalised workouts and nutrition plans, a TDEE calculator, membership options, and a profile dashboard.

## How It's Made:
K-Fit was built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, and jQuery to demonstrate front-end web development skills and user interface design principles:
  
  HTML - Website structure and content.
  CSS / Bootstrap - Styling, responsive layout, and UI components.
  JavaScript - Core functionality, logic, and calculator implementation.
  jQuery - DOM manipulation, animations, event handling.

## Responsiveness & Accessibility
K-Fit is fully responsive and optimised for viewing across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, utilising Bootstrap's flexible grid system and responsive class. Its accessibility was also checked using SilkTide and through testing on the WebbIE web browser.

## Key Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Structuring modular, semantic HTML.
- Implementing responsive design using Bootstrap
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript and jQuery
- Managing UI states through dynamic DOM manipulation.
- Designing a consistent and user-centred interface.
